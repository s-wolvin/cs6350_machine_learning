## Stochastic Sub-Gradient Descent for Primal Domain SVM
### primal_svm_partA.py
Implement the stochastic sub-gradient descent for SVM using the schedule of learning rate r = r0 / (1 + (r0/a) * t).


### primal_svm_partB.py
Implement the stochastic sub-gradient descent for SVM using the schedule of learning rate r = r0 / (1 + t).
