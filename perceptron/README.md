# HW 2: Perceptron Algorithm

## perceptronAlgorithm.py
Implement a perceptron algorithm on the bank-note to predict if the bank note is genuine or forged using a python script. The possible algorithms to choose from are 'standard', 'voted', and 'average'. To choose with version of perceptron to use, change the 'prcptrnAlgorithm' variable. 

run_perceptronAlgorithm.sh - shell script which runs perceptronAlgorithm.py using python3.8
