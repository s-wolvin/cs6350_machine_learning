# Homework 1
These folders hold the decision tree algorithms for categorical and numerical data. More specifically, the categorical folder contains the code for problem 2 and the numerical folder contains the code for problem 3. Calibrate.csv is the tennis dataset, which was used to check the accuracy of the python code in subsequent folders. 

# categorical_decision_tree:
car - folder containing the car training and test data

decisionTree_categorical_main.py - python script which creates the decison tree for the car data. Will pull the car data from the car folder.

run.sh - shell script which runs the python script using python3.8

# numerical_decision_tree:
bank - folder containing the bank training and test data

decisionTree_numerical_main.py - python script which creates the decison tree for the bank data. Will pull the bank data from the bank folder. Categorical data will be treated as categorical. Numerical data will be split into upper and lower values by the median value.

run.sh - shell script which runs the python script using python3.8
